# ping_subnets

A product your team is designing has multiple devices that communicate with each other using ethernet networks. For redundancy, there are 2 networks for each device. You are responsible for writing a Python library that provides a function which returns a list of IP addresses that are pingable on one network but not the other. We will review your code the same as we would review any pull request at Joby and want to see you give us your best in performance and style! We will set the review up to be anonymous to ensure an unbiased review of your submission.
